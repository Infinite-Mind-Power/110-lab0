What up? I hope you are not too salty as the heat 
of the sun is squiggling your sweat glands, so they 
puke unflavoured and nasty transparent which is the same 
as gatored that is a liquid substance called sweat! We 
are here to lower your metabolisms burden, and reduce the 
unwanted shock of climate change upon your largest organ 
by flushing some lemoniac to your throat, so that your pharnyx 
cools down like a diesel engine that cools down after it 
overheats by devouring coolant! So, lets roll!
